Greetings of the day. 
This project is done by me during training period at internshipstudio (Jan 2022).
My mentor helped me a lot in this project.
This project basically contain how to analyse and predict adview on youtube.
I gained a lot of knowledge about Python Machine Learning libraries like (NUMPY, PANDAS, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Joblib, etc.).

Thank You.
